    - View renders to DOM and interfaces with the user
      - Input: data streams
      - Output: raw interaction streams
    - Controller: interprets user interaction and notifies model of changes
      - Input: raw interaction streams
      - Output: interpreted interaction streams
    - Marble should export only mouseDownStream, mouseMoveStream, mouseUpStream
    - All the intelligent streams in Marble should go to some controller class
      which observes Marble.mouse____Stream
